PROJECT STATEMENT:

The project focuses on building an intelligent cybersecurity platform powered by AI and machine learning.

The system is designed to proactively identify vulnerabilities, suspicious patterns, and potential threats across networks and endpoints.

By leveraging advanced analytics, AI models, and behavioral monitoring, the platform minimizes human intervention while maintaining robust security.

It aims to provide organizations with predictive insights, enabling faster response to evolving cyber threats and improved decision-making.

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:

Proactive Threat Prediction: Early identification of malware, phishing attempts, and suspicious activities.

Behavioral Analysis: Detection of insider threats through user and device activity monitoring.

Automated Response: AI-driven mitigation actions, reducing reliance on manual operations.

Enhanced Security Posture: Strengthened network resilience and reduced attack surface.

Data-Driven Insights: Analytics and reports to support informed cybersecurity decisions.
